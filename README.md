beerfind.me
===========

Beerfind.me project is a notification service using data from the untapped API and the twitter API.

Discription of the Service:
Users can set beer names or names to be searched in the data recieved from untapped. This data set is checkins from untapped users where the location of the check in is specified. This data is set to a lat and long with a radius of 25 miles. 

Users are notified when a beer is in the data set. This notification id's an @username tweet from the beerfind.me Twitter account.

Q. Why not just use untapped??
A. Please do use untapped! However some users may not want to check in or use the untapped app at all. They still want beers. Twitter is much more widley used and this would allow non untapped uses to get updates from the untapped data. This also may get reluctant users to join untapped and hopefully making the crowd sourced data feed better.


This repo is this readme and the home page for beerfind.me


I may add the API calls, users login pages, search page, etc.. later.

I am using this repo to track issues I experience and to document my progress.
