beerfind.me
===========

Beerfind.me project is a notification service using data from the untapped API and the twitter API.

Discription of the Service:
Users can set beer names or names to be searched in the data recieved from untapped. This data set is checkins from untapped users where the location of the check in is specified. This data is set to a lat and long with a radius of 25 miles. 


This repo is this readme and the home page for beerfind.me

I may add the API calls, users login pages, search page, etc.. later.

I am using this reop to track issues I experience and to document my progress.
